## Modern Angular With Signals Course

This repository contains the code of the Modern Angular With Signals Course.

# Installation pre-requisites

IMPORTANT: Please use Node 22 (Long Term Support version).

# Installing the Angular CLI

Start by doing a global installation of the Angular CLI:

    npm install -g @angular/cli

# How To prepare this repository

    npm install

# Running the local backend server

In order to be able to provide more realistic examples, we will need in our playground a small REST API backend server.

We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

# To run the Frontend Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start

You can also start the frontend application using the following command:

    ng serve

The application is visible in port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
